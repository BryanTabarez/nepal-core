## AlSubscriptionGroup class

This is a simple utility to manage a list of subscriptions, which may be AlTriggerSubscriptions or RxJS subscriptions. It exposes a method `manage` to add new subscriptions, and a method `cancelAll` to unsubscribe from all subscriptions. That is all it does.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class AlSubscriptionGroup 
```
