## AlStopwatch class

AlStopwatch is an attempt to encapsulate a few basic timer-related use cases into a simple interface. Most uses cases can be handled by one of the three static methods: `Stopwatch.later` - creates a Stopwatch instance that won't be executed until someone calls its `now` or `again` methods. `Stopwatch.once` - creates a Stopwatch instance that executes once after a specified delay, defaulting to 0. `Stopwatch.repeatedly` - creates a Stopwatch instance that executes repeatedly at a given interval until its `cancel` method is called.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class AlStopwatch 
```

## Constructors

|  Constructor | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [(constructor)(callback)](./common.alstopwatch._constructor_.md) |  | Constructs a new instance of the <code>AlStopwatch</code> class |

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [again](./common.alstopwatch.again.md) |  | <code>(delay?: number) =&gt; void</code> | Schedules a repeated execution. This method has no effect if there is already a scheduled execution. |
|  [callback](./common.alstopwatch.callback.md) |  | <code>{</code><br/><code>        (): void;</code><br/><code>    }</code> |  |
|  [cancel](./common.alstopwatch.cancel.md) |  | <code>() =&gt; void</code> | Cancels a scheduled execution. |
|  [interval](./common.alstopwatch.interval.md) |  | <code>number</code> |  |
|  [now](./common.alstopwatch.now.md) |  | <code>() =&gt; void</code> | Executes the timer immediately (literally, right now!) |
|  [reschedule](./common.alstopwatch.reschedule.md) |  | <code>(delay?: number) =&gt; void</code> | Schedules a repeated execution. This method will cancel any previously scheduled execution. |
|  [tick](./common.alstopwatch.tick.md) |  | <code>() =&gt; void</code> | The timer's tick handler; executes the callback and, for single-fire timers, clears the timer handle. |
|  [timer](./common.alstopwatch.timer.md) |  | <code>any</code> |  |

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [later(callback)](./common.alstopwatch.later.md) | <code>static</code> | A static method to generate an unscheduled timer |
|  [once(callback, delay)](./common.alstopwatch.once.md) | <code>static</code> | A static method to generate a timer that will execute once after a given number of milliseconds. |
|  [repeatedly(callback, interval, beginImmediately)](./common.alstopwatch.repeatedly.md) | <code>static</code> | A static method to generate a timer that will execute intermittently. Note that this implementation deviates from the behavior of setInterval by \*defaulting\* to firing the timer immediately. |
